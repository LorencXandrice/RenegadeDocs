Illegal Activities

    Interfering in active police scenes as a third party is not allowed. This includes saving friends taken as a hostage or hunting down car thieves. Let the scenario play out, then react afterwards. 

    Getting a hostage to get your friend out of police custody is poor role play. The police will comply with the demands, but will process the individual as normal (Get their fingerprint, remove illegals and other weapons) then negotiate with the hostage scenario. Abuse of this rule will result in immediate sentencing to prison without demands met. 

    You must wait for police to show up to a robbery once triggered. If it has been 5 minutes after you completed your last action, then you may leave the scene. 
    For example: You are doing a store robbery, and you only had the intention to rob the registers, the 5 minutes start once you finish the 2nd register. 

    All robbery heists must have a hostage in order for the police to not breach. You may not take the locals in the store, or the clerk in the store hostage. 

    Hostages are 1 demand per hostage. No spike strips include free passage to the vehicle used in the heist. 

    Demands for hostages must be clear and concise. Clear Passage & No Spikes counts as 1 demand. 

    You may not bait cops by using heists to start a shoot out. There needs to be some interaction before the shootout begins. 

    If you do not keep a gun out or pointed at the hostage, you may be breached by the police. 

    No crime is allowed 30 min. before a server restart.
