Gang Rules

    When in gang activities with other gangs, you must wear something like a bandana to indicate that you are part of that gang. When in a gang war, you must state what is considered your gang clothing for the other gang to look for, i.e a yellow face bandana. 

    Gang wars cannot last forever. A ending must be determined from both sides. If a war has lasted too long or there is no ending, then staff can intervene with the leaders.

    If you create a discord for your gang, a member of staff must be in the discord with full admin permissions or able to see all channels with no restrictions.
