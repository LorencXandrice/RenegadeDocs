General Server Rules

    Stream sniping is prohibited. 
Presence in a streamer’s chat while on the server will be assumed as evidence of stream sniping if there is a complaint submitted.






Any music played on the server must be DMCA compliant, if you are hosting an event with DMCA music, you must make that clear in the announcement or advertisement. 




Glitching/Exploiting is prohibited. Failure to report any exploits or glitches will result in a character wipe, or a potential removal from the community. 
Use of game mechanics (intended or otherwise) to gain an unfair advantage is considered exploiting (e.g., using known bugs or using game features in inappropriate and unintended ways).


Logging out during conflict (“combat-logging”) is prohibited.
Players must be in character at all times on-server. This includes communication and actions.
In Character conflict is to be resolved In Character. If rule-related concerns arise, players are expected to remain In Character to the conclusion of the scene, and file a player report.
    
    
    No win-only mentalities. Counter play is necessary to successful roleplay.
No Shoot on sight: No Random Death Matching (RDM) or Kill on Sight (KOS). All conflict must be initiated verbally or with an abundance of story lead-up within close proximity of the conflict. The target of a conflict attack must be able to recognize they’re being threatened with harm, why and by whom before they’re injured.


Metagaming is prohibited.
You must not use external communication to communicate with other players while on the server.

You are not your character; do not act on or disclose information your character didn’t gain on-server.
Power gaming is prohibited.
Roleplay that does not give other players the opportunity to roleplay their character’s own actions is considered power gaming (e.g., using the /me command to force an outcome: /me knocks them out with the butt of a gun instead of /me hits your temple with the butt of a gun ).

    
    You must value your life, and the lives of others. For example, do not attempt to draw a weapon while being held at gunpoint or carelessly injure NPCs.

    Try not to script stories. It is okay to set up loose story lines at the onset of a story, but to attempt to control a narrative is against the server rules. This server is about collaborative storytelling.

    Do not break character if someone is potentially breaking a rule. Open a ticket in the discord, or do a /report to let the staff team know and we will handle it. Remember there are other people around you who are also roleplaying and you need to be considerate of other people. We are all adults, don't throw fits and cry because something isn't going your way. 

    Groups, Families or Enterprises (Civilian or Criminal) are limited to 15 people max. This includes player run businesses but excludes Police, EMS & Mechanics. 

    You are not allowed to play a serial killer without approval from staff. This is to assure you have the support you need from the admin team to accomplish your story and to ensure you are on the same page as the staff team. 

    NEW LIFE RULE:
    - If you pressed E to respawn or the timer expired and you respawned at the hospital; You do not remember anything leading up to your death.

    Illegal activities are limited to 4 criminals max. The same rule will apply to police.

    Ocean dumping a person or a vehicle is not allowed unless there is a role play story leading up to the ocean dumping. 

     Initiation must happen before any combat begins. Initiation can be a phone call, text message, or birdy message with confirmation that the other party is aware you initiated. A phone call is preferred as you hear the other person initiate on you. 

    Jumps are allowed while in a pursuit, but ocean dumping your car is not. 

    We are a stop and go server. Treat all red lights as a stop sign. Your car must come to a complete stop for at least 3 seconds then you may proceed. 

    Any purchases from the Tebex store may not be sold in game for money. If you wish to give someone else a purchase, please open a ticket and let staff know.
