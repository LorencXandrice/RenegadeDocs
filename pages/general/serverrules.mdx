General Server Rules

    You must value your life, and the lives of others. For example, do not attempt to draw a weapon while being held at gunpoint or carelessly injure NPCs.

    Try not to script stories. It is okay to set up loose story lines at the onset of a story, but to attempt to control a narrative is against the server rules. This server is about collaborative storytelling.

    Do not break character if someone is potentially breaking a rule. Open a ticket in the discord, or do a /report to let the staff team know and we will handle it. Remember there are other people around you who are also roleplaying and you need to be considerate of other people. We are all adults, don't throw fits and cry because something isn't going your way. 

    Groups, Families or Enterprises (Civilian or Criminal) are limited to 15 people max. This includes player run businesses but excludes Police, EMS & Mechanics. 

    You are not allowed to play a serial killer without approval from staff. This is to assure you have the support you need from the admin team to accomplish your story and to ensure you are on the same page as the staff team. 

    NEW LIFE RULE:
    - If you pressed E to respawn or the timer expired and you respawned at the hospital; You do not remember anything leading up to your death.

    Illegal activities are limited to 4 criminals max. The same rule will apply to police.

    Ocean dumping a person or a vehicle is not allowed unless there is a role play story leading up to the ocean dumping. 

     Initiation must happen before any combat begins. Initiation can be a phone call, text message, or birdy message with confirmation that the other party is aware you initiated. A phone call is preferred as you hear the other person initiate on you. 

    Jumps are allowed while in a pursuit, but ocean dumping your car is not. 

    We are a stop and go server. Treat all red lights as a stop sign. Your car must come to a complete stop for at least 3 seconds then you may proceed. 

    Any purchases from the Tebex store may not be sold in game for money. If you wish to give someone else a purchase, please open a ticket and let staff know.
