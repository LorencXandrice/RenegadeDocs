Community Guidelines

    No win-only mentalities. Counter play is necessary to successful roleplay.

    No Shoot on sight: No Random Death Matching (RDM) or Kill on Sight (KOS). All conflict must be initiated verbally or with an abundance of story lead-up within close proximity of the conflict. The target of a conflict attack must be able to recognize they’re being threatened with harm, why and by whom before they’re injured.

    Metagaming is prohibited.

    You are not your character; do not act on or disclose information your character didn’t gain on-server.

    Power gaming is prohibited.

    Roleplay that does not give other players the opportunity to roleplay their character’s own actions is considered power gaming (e.g., using the /me command to force an outcome: /me knocks them out with the butt of a gun instead of /me hits your temple with the butt of a gun ).

    Stream sniping is prohibited. 
    Presence in a streamer’s chat while on the server will be assumed as evidence of stream sniping if there is a complaint submitted.

    RP that violates the Twitch Terms of Service (ToS), Twitch Community Guidelines and Kick Community Guidelines is prohibited.

    Players and their characters must be 18 years or older.

    Players must have English fluency enough to easily understand and be understood.

    Admin actions via Discord must be given priority.

    If staff contacts you to discuss a timeout, the ban will not be lifted (regardless of its initial duration) until you have spoken to the admin. If staff contacts you to discuss a rule break and you do not acknowledge the message with a response, you may be timed out until you do so.

    Be respectful of other players in the community; personal insults or attacks outside of roleplay are strictly prohibited.

    Speaking poorly of others on stream, in chats or elsewhere will not be tolerated. If you have a concern that someone broke a community or on-server rule, submit a report.
    Any player caught harassing or bullying another player on the server, or outside of the server but in relation to their presence on the server, will be permanently removed and barred from the current and any future allowlist.

    Voice Communication:
    Players must have a good quality and functioning microphone and headset for RP.
    You must not use external communication to communicate with other players while on the server.
    Any music played on the server must be DMCA compliant, if you are hosting an event with DMCA music, you must make that clear in the announcement or advertisement. 

    Make use of the appropriate tools and channels to report issues or request support. Do not DM staff members or other management roles unless it is an emergency. 

    Glitching/Exploiting is prohibited. Failure to report any exploits or glitches will result in a character wipe, or a potential removal from the community. 

    Use of game mechanics (intended or otherwise) to gain an unfair advantage is considered exploiting (e.g., using known bugs or using game features in inappropriate and unintended ways).

    Logging out during conflict (“combat-logging”) is prohibited.

    Players must be in character at all times on-server. This includes communication and actions.

    In Character conflict is to be resolved In Character. If rule-related concerns arise, players are expected to remain In Character to the conclusion of the scene, and file a player report.

Donations

    All donations/purchases on the Tebex Store are permanent and non-refundable. If there has been a mistake or any other circumstance, please contact staff immediately via the ticket system. 

    If you are banned, or removed from the community, your donation will not be refunded. It is your responsibility to maintain your status on the server. 

Content Restrictions

Extreme Violence: OOC consent must be obtained through Discord between all parties before torture/mutilation RP. Descriptions (verbal or /me) cannot be overly descriptive or gruesome.

    Hanging and scalping are not allowed.

    Prohibited Topics: Roleplay and references to the following topics, both verbal and written, are absolutely not permitted by Renegade Roleplay, or allowed on any of its servers, Discord, or other hosted services and may result in a permanent community ban:

    Racism or Sexism

    Suicide or self-harm

    Children/Pregnancy roleplay

    Erotic Role Play (ERP), especially anything actually or inferred to be non-consensual. Any and all ERP must be in an instanced area (any area that teleports you into the zone). If there is a MLO or interior to a building that you can just walk into, then it is not allowed. 

    Slavery roleplay

    No hate speech, slurs, or portrayals of hate crimes

    Any and all IC Events must advertise if DMCA music will be played at such event. (Players will be able to use the /streamermode command to toggle music on/off at any time)

General Server Rules

    You must value your life, and the lives of others. For example, do not attempt to draw a weapon while being held at gunpoint or carelessly injure NPCs.

    Try not to script stories. It is okay to set up loose story lines at the onset of a story, but to attempt to control a narrative is against the server rules. This server is about collaborative storytelling.

    Do not break character if someone is potentially breaking a rule. Open a ticket in the discord, or do a /report to let the staff team know and we will handle it. Remember there are other people around you who are also roleplaying and you need to be considerate of other people. We are all adults, don't throw fits and cry because something isn't going your way. 

    Groups, Families or Enterprises (Civilian or Criminal) are limited to 15 people max. This includes player run businesses but excludes Police, EMS & Mechanics. 

    You are not allowed to play a serial killer without approval from staff. This is to assure you have the support you need from the admin team to accomplish your story and to ensure you are on the same page as the staff team. 

    NEW LIFE RULE:
    - If you pressed E to respawn or the timer expired and you respawned at the hospital; You do not remember anything leading up to your death.

    Illegal activities are limited to 4 criminals max. The same rule will apply to police.

    Ocean dumping a person or a vehicle is not allowed unless there is a role play story leading up to the ocean dumping. 

     Initiation must happen before any combat begins. Initiation can be a phone call, text message, or birdy message with confirmation that the other party is aware you initiated. A phone call is preferred as you hear the other person initiate on you. 

    Jumps are allowed while in a pursuit, but ocean dumping your car is not. 

    We are a stop and go server. Treat all red lights as a stop sign. Your car must come to a complete stop for at least 3 seconds then you may proceed. 

    Any purchases from the Tebex store may not be sold in game for money. If you wish to give someone else a purchase, please open a ticket and let staff know. 

Gang Rules

    When in gang activities with other gangs, you must wear something like a bandana to indicate that you are part of that gang. When in a gang war, you must state what is considered your gang clothing for the other gang to look for, i.e a yellow face bandana. 

    Gang wars cannot last forever. A ending must be determined from both sides. If a war has lasted too long or there is no ending, then staff can intervene with the leaders.

    If you create a discord for your gang, a member of staff must be in the discord with full admin permissions or able to see all channels with no restrictions. 

Illegal Activities

    Interfering in active police scenes as a third party is not allowed. This includes saving friends taken as a hostage or hunting down car thieves. Let the scenario play out, then react afterwards. 

    Getting a hostage to get your friend out of police custody is poor role play. The police will comply with the demands, but will process the individual as normal (Get their fingerprint, remove illegals and other weapons) then negotiate with the hostage scenario. Abuse of this rule will result in immediate sentencing to prison without demands met. 

    You must wait for police to show up to a robbery once triggered. If it has been 5 minutes after you completed your last action, then you may leave the scene. 
    For example: You are doing a store robbery, and you only had the intention to rob the registers, the 5 minutes start once you finish the 2nd register. 

    All robbery heists must have a hostage in order for the police to not breach. You may not take the locals in the store, or the clerk in the store hostage. 

    Hostages are 1 demand per hostage. No spike strips include free passage to the vehicle used in the heist. 

    Demands for hostages must be clear and concise. Clear Passage & No Spikes counts as 1 demand. 

    You may not bait cops by using heists to start a shoot out. There needs to be some interaction before the shootout begins. 

    If you do not keep a gun out or pointed at the hostage, you may be breached by the police. 

    No crime is allowed 30 min. before a server restart.

    Penal Code is IC knowledge. Changes will be often, its up to your character to be up-to-date with these changes. You can find the penal code here" https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hqnAtxl0d1x4YH16EVrgZJoONZscbPPny5tbEYbFl8Q/edit?usp=sharing

    Command of any government entity cannot be on the roster of a gang/club/mc. All government entities need SOPs regarding corruption.
