Community Guidelines

    No win-only mentalities. Counter play is necessary to successful roleplay.

    No Shoot on sight: No Random Death Matching (RDM) or Kill on Sight (KOS). All conflict must be initiated verbally or with an abundance of story lead-up within close proximity of the conflict. The target of a conflict attack must be able to recognize they’re being threatened with harm, why and by whom before they’re injured.

    Metagaming is prohibited.

    You are not your character; do not act on or disclose information your character didn’t gain on-server.

    Power gaming is prohibited.

    Roleplay that does not give other players the opportunity to roleplay their character’s own actions is considered power gaming (e.g., using the /me command to force an outcome: /me knocks them out with the butt of a gun instead of /me hits your temple with the butt of a gun ).

    Stream sniping is prohibited. 
    Presence in a streamer’s chat while on the server will be assumed as evidence of stream sniping if there is a complaint submitted.

    RP that violates the Twitch Terms of Service (ToS), Twitch Community Guidelines and Kick Community Guidelines is prohibited.

    Players and their characters must be 18 years or older.

    Players must have English fluency enough to easily understand and be understood.

    Admin actions via Discord must be given priority.

    If staff contacts you to discuss a timeout, the ban will not be lifted (regardless of its initial duration) until you have spoken to the admin. If staff contacts you to discuss a rule break and you do not acknowledge the message with a response, you may be timed out until you do so.

    Be respectful of other players in the community; personal insults or attacks outside of roleplay are strictly prohibited.

    Speaking poorly of others on stream, in chats or elsewhere will not be tolerated. If you have a concern that someone broke a community or on-server rule, submit a report.
    Any player caught harassing or bullying another player on the server, or outside of the server but in relation to their presence on the server, will be permanently removed and barred from the current and any future allowlist.

    Voice Communication:
    Players must have a good quality and functioning microphone and headset for RP.
    You must not use external communication to communicate with other players while on the server.
    Any music played on the server must be DMCA compliant, if you are hosting an event with DMCA music, you must make that clear in the announcement or advertisement. 

    Make use of the appropriate tools and channels to report issues or request support. Do not DM staff members or other management roles unless it is an emergency. 

    Glitching/Exploiting is prohibited. Failure to report any exploits or glitches will result in a character wipe, or a potential removal from the community. 

    Use of game mechanics (intended or otherwise) to gain an unfair advantage is considered exploiting (e.g., using known bugs or using game features in inappropriate and unintended ways).

    Logging out during conflict (“combat-logging”) is prohibited.

    Players must be in character at all times on-server. This includes communication and actions.

    In Character conflict is to be resolved In Character. If rule-related concerns arise, players are expected to remain In Character to the conclusion of the scene, and file a player report.
