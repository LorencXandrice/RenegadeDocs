# 🖥️ Clearing Your Cache

We don't typically recommend clearing your cache, but if you need to, follow the steps below:
1. You should have a 📁 shortcut that takes you to the folder directly, called **FiveM Application Data**.\
a. If not, *search* **`AppData\Local\FiveM\FiveM.app`** in your 📁 Windows Explorer address bar\
OR\
b. *Press* `Windows` + `R` and *search* **`%AppData%`** → *open* `📁 Local` → `📁 FiveM` → `📁 FiveM Application Data`\
c. We highly recommend creating a shortcut for the `📁 FiveM Application Data` folder for ease of access in the future.

2. *Open* the `📁 Data` folder **only** *delete* the following folders:\
a. 📁 cache\
b. 📁 server-cache-priv\
c. 📁 server-cache


⚠️ Do *not* delete the game folder, or you will have to re-download the **entire** game cache.

📡 When you reconnect to the server, you'll see all of the resources re-downloaded!
