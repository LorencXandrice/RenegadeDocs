# üñ•Ô∏èClearing Your Cache

I don't typically recommend clearing your cache, but if you need to.. here are the steps.

If you didn't, then you should have a shortcut that takes you to the folder directly, called "FiveM Application Data". You can also just enter %localappdata%\FiveM\FiveM.app\cache in your Windows Explorer address bar or Start Menu:

Go inside the data folder and delete only these three folders

Data/cache/
Data/server-cache-priv/
Data/server-cache/

Don't delete the game folder or you will have to re-download the entire game cache.

After that, you'll see all of the resources re-downloaded when you reconnect to the server!
