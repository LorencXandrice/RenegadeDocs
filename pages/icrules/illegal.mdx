# §4 😈 Illegal Activities 😈

1. 📃 **Penal Code is In-Character knowledge and can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hqnAtxl0d1x4YH16EVrgZJoONZscbPPny5tbEYbFl8Q/edit?usp=sharin).**\
a. Changes will be made often. It is up to your character to be up-to-date with these changes. 

2. 🕡 **No heists or robberies are allowed 30 minutes before a server restart.**

3. 4️⃣ **Rule of 4 - Illegal activities are limited to *4 criminals* max. Police are also limited to *4 officers* max.**\
a. No more than 4 individuals are allowed to be involved in any illegal scenario at any given time. Once the 4 participants for an activity are confirmed, no player may swap in or out of the group until the activity is complete.

4. ⏰ **You must wait for police to show up to a robbery once triggered.**\
a. If it has been *10 minutes* since your first action (i.e., hack) in the robbery, then you may leave the scene.\
b. Example - You are doing a store robbery, and you only had the intention to rob the registers. The 10 minutes start once you finish the 1st register.

5. 🤐 **All robbery heists must have a hostage in order for the police to *not breach*.**\
a. You may *not* take the locals in the store, or the clerk in the store hostage.\
b. If you do not keep a gun out or pointed at the hostage, you may be breached by the police.\
c. Hostages are 1 demand per hostage. Demands for hostages must be clear and concise.\
d. Clear Passage & No spike strips counts as *1 demand*. No spike strips include free passage to the vehicle used in the heist.

6. 🔫 **You may not bait cops by using heists to start a shoot out. There needs to be some interaction before the shootout begins.**

7. 🤡 **Interfering in active police scenes as a third party is not allowed.**\
a. This includes saving friends taken as a hostage or hunting down car thieves. Let the scenario play out, then react afterwards.\
b. Getting a hostage to get your friend out of police custody is **poor roleplay**. The police will comply with the demands, but will process the individual as normal (i.e., get their fingerprint, remove illegals and other weapons, etc.) then negotiate with the hostage scenario. Abuse of this rule will result in immediate sentencing to prison without demands met.

8. 💰 **You may rob players including government officials, but *pocket wiping (i.e., stealing all items from a player's inventory) is not allowed*. Please be considerate of other players.**\
a. Exception - You may not rob players in the <font color="#c70000"> **Red Zone** </font>.

9. 🔴 **X's Cache - First to secure the loot wins!**\
a. This is a citywide event. Once the loot is secured, the <font color="#c70000"> **Red Zone** </font> will disappear, ending the event.\
b. Every player may participate in the event. You will not face getting arrested by cops for participating in the event, but the cops may search and seize all illegal items in your current possession before bringing you to the hospital.\
c. The only rp we would expect is going to the <font color="#c70000"> **Red Zone** </font> with your buddies (Rule of 4 applies) and communicating via radio to work together to secure the loot.\
d. You may not roll up to the person/group at the conclusion of the event to gun them down (i.e., this would now be considered RDM) or rob them of the loot and other items from their body. - You snooze, you lose. Better luck next time!\
e. You do not need to bring any downed individuals to the hospital if you don't want to.

10. When producing (not packaging) *meth* or *coke*, you **cannot** be in a teleported interior such as a housing shell or apartment / office. You also cannot do this in a hidden locked door area. If the doorlock is on a door, it must be visible if it's related to a MLO.
