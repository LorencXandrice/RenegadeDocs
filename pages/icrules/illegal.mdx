# §4 😈 Illegal Activities 😈

1. 📃 Penal Code is In-Character knowledge and can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hqnAtxl0d1x4YH16EVrgZJoONZscbPPny5tbEYbFl8Q/edit?usp=sharin).\
a. Changes will be made often. It is up to your character to be up-to-date with these changes. 

2. 🕡 No crime is allowed 30 minutes before a server restart.

3. 4️⃣ Rule of 4 - Illegal activities are limited to **4 criminals** max. Police are also limited to **4 officers** max.\
a. No more than 4 individuals are allowed to be involved in any illegal scenario at any given time. Once the 4 participants for an activity are confirmed, no player may swap in or out of the group until the activity is complete.

4. ⏰ You must wait for police to show up to a robbery once triggered.\
a. If it has been *10 minutes* since your first action (i.e., hack) in the robbery, then you may leave the scene.\
b. Example - You are doing a store robbery, and you only had the intention to rob the registers. The 10 minutes start once you finish the 1st register.

5. 🤐 All robbery heists must have a hostage in order for the police to *not breach*. You may *not* take the locals in the store, or the clerk in the store hostage.\
a. If you do not keep a gun out or pointed at the hostage, you may be breached by the police.\
b. Hostages are 1 demand per hostage. Demands for hostages must be clear and concise.\
c. Clear Passage & No spike strips counts as *1 demand*. No spike strips include free passage to the vehicle used in the heist.

6. 🔫 You may not bait cops by using heists to start a shoot out. There needs to be some interaction before the shootout begins.

7. 🤡 Interfering in active police scenes as a third party is not allowed.\
a. This includes saving friends taken as a hostage or hunting down car thieves. Let the scenario play out, then react afterwards.\
b. Getting a hostage to get your friend out of police custody is **poor roleplay**. The police will comply with the demands, but will process the individual as normal (Get their fingerprint, remove illegals and other weapons) then negotiate with the hostage scenario. Abuse of this rule will result in immediate sentencing to prison without demands met.

8. 💰 You may rob players including government officials, but pocket wiping (i.e., stealing all items from a player's inventory) is not allowed. Please be considerate of other players.

9. 😎 Command of any government entity cannot be on the roster of a gang/club/mc. All government entities need SOPs regarding corruption.
