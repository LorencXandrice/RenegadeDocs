#### Before connecting to the server
1. Go to `Game` and do the following:\
a. *Toggle* to the `Release` version if not selected already. If you are on `Latest (Unstable)`, there is a current Fivem issue where you will be stuck on the loading screen.\
b. *Select* `Fix 'UI lag' at high GPU usage, but may cause reliability issues with GPU crashes (requires restart)`

2. To mute the default FiveM background music, go to `Interface` and *uncheck* `Enable background music while idle in the main menu`

3. Setup your screen capture application. We recommend **ShareX** or **Gyazo**.\
a. If using ShareX, we recommend using [Fivemerr](https://discord.com/channels/1256876303764951101/1259532834033373225) or [Fivemanage](https://discord.com/channels/1128724025724633128/1216322240711229541) as your image upload destination.\
b. Imgur blocked FiveM entirely, so your images will not appear if shared within the game.

4. Setup your video capture application. You can capture funny, memorable clips with your friends or for use in bug/player reports.

#### After connecting to the server

1. Go to `Voice Chat` and do the following:\
a. *Toggle* `Voice Chat Enabled` to `On`\

d. Ensure your `Output Device` (i.e., what you hear) and `Input Device` (i.e., your mic) are to the appropriate device. Align these to your general voice and audio Windows Settings.
