# §2 🖥️ Clearing Your Cache 🖥️

<Callout type="default">
We highly recommend creating a shortcut for the `📁 FiveM Application Data` folder for ease of access in the future.
</Callout>

We don't typically recommend clearing your cache, but if you need to, follow the steps below:
1. You should have a 📁 shortcut that takes you to the folder directly, called **FiveM Application Data**.\
a. If not, *press* `Windows` + `E` and *search* **`AppData\Local\FiveM\FiveM.app`** in your `📁 Windows Explorer`\
OR\
b. *Press* `Windows` + `R` and *search* **`%AppData%`** → *open* `📁 Local` → `📁 FiveM` → `📁 FiveM Application Data`

2. *Open* the `📁 Data` folder **only** *delete* the following folders:\
a. 📁 cache\
b. 📁 nui-storage\
c. 📁 server-cache-priv\
d. 📁 server-cache

<Callout type="error">
  **Don't delete the 📁 `game-storage` folder, or you will have to re-download the *entire* game cache.**
</Callout>

📡 When you reconnect to the server, you'll see all of the resources re-downloaded, so please be patient as you re-download all the assets.
