# ยง7 Lore Friendly

Our server maintains a "lore friendly" environment, which means all content must comply with FiveM's [Terms of Service](https://runtime.fivem.net/platform-license-agreement-12-sept-2023.pdf) and stay true to the Grand Theft Auto Lore.

### Brands and Copyrighted Material
- Real-world brands and copyrighted logos are strictly prohibited
- Instead of brands like "BAPE," "SUPREME," "YEEZY," "NIKE," or "ADIDAS," use fictional alternatives or generic descriptions
- Create original branding that fits the GTA aesthetic

### Vehicles
- Vehicle manufacturers must follow GTA's naming conventions (Vapid, Ubermacht, Benefactor, Pegassi, etc.)
- No real brands like "HONDA," "KIA," "TOYOTA," "BMW," "MERCEDES," or "FERRARI"
- Custom vehicle liveries should use fictional sponsors and branding

### Clothing and Accessories
- Clothing items cannot feature real brand names or logos
- Sports team references should use GTA's fictional teams (like the Los Santos Panic)
- Create original designs or use generic styling without brand identifiers

### Businesses, Organizations, and Gangs
- Player-owned businesses should have original names and branding and avoid real-world references (i.e., no "McDonald's," "Walmart," "Starbucks," etc.)
- Government and law enforcement should follow GTA's fictional structure
- Gang names should avoid real-world names, such as Bloods, Crips, Latin Kings, Hells Angels, etc.
- News organizations should use fictional names (not "CNN," "BBC," etc.)

**Why this matters:**
When staff members mention that something "needs to be lore friendly," they're ensuring the server remains legally compliant with FiveM's Terms of Service while maintaining the authentic Grand Theft Auto experience. This protects both the server and its community from potential legal issues while preserving the immersive roleplay environment.
