# Â§1 ðŸ‘© Character Creation ðŸ‘¨

<Callout type="info">
The information on this page applies for your first character and any additional characters you create.

Please allow yourself **at least *30 minutes*** to create your character.
</Callout>

#### **Backstory**

As you are creating your character, reflect on a compelling backstory for your FiveM character to enhance your roleplaying experience:\
a. Determine where your character comes from (e.g., hometown, family background, etc.)\
b. Identify major events (i.e., personal milestones, traumatic experiences, pivotal decisions, etc.) that have significantly impacted your character's life \
c. Outline important relationships your character has (e.g., family, friends, rivals, etc.)\
d. Establish goals and motivations for your character\
e. Develop traits and behavior for your character\
f. You may use a common quote from an influential/famous person or TV show/movie character as something your character says, but you must not copy the influential/famous person or TV show/movie character's story as your character's backstory or roleplay.

#### **Character Select**

1. *Select* the option to **`REGISTER A NEW CITIZEN`**.\
a. If you have reached the character slot limit, the option to **`REGISTER A NEW CITIZEN`** will not appear.  
b. To resolve this issue, you will need to either: delete one of your characters (scroll to the last section of this page for more info) or consider visiting our [Tebex](https://store.renegaderp.net) store page to expand your character slot limit.

2. On the left side of your screen, a **`Citizen Registration`** screen will pop up.

3. Create your character's **name**.\
a. You must not use your IRL name.\
b. If you choose to use the name of an influential/famous person or TV show/movie character, your character's backstory, traits, and behavior must be completely separate of the influential/famous person or TV show/movie character. 

4. *Select* your character's **sex**.

5. Create your character's **date of birth**.\
a. Please refrain from using your IRL birthday to protest your personally identifiable information.

6. *Select* your character's **nationality**.\
a. You can type the name of your preferred country in this field instead of scrolling through all of the options.

7. *Select* **`COMPLETE REGISTRATION`**.

#### **Character Appearance**

This is where you will customize your character's face, skin tone, hair, makeup, clothing, and accessories. These customizations are *not* permanent. There are places within the city for you to get cosmetic surgery as well as visit beauty salons, clothing stores, and tattoo parlors.

As you navigate through the **`Character Appearance`** screen, some useful keybinds are:
- Use the **`W`** and **`S`** or either your **`Left Mouse Button`** or **`Right Mouse Button`** to spin your character.
- Use the **`A`** and **`D`** to move the camera view vertically up and down, respectively. 
- Use your **`Scroll Wheel on your mouse`** to zoom in or out of your camera view. Alternatively, you may click on the `ðŸ“·` on the *right side* of your screen.

<Callout type="error">
**DO NOT** *press* the **`ESC`** key at any point while you are in the `Character Appearance` screen. Doing so will inadvertently exit you out of the `Character Appearance` screen and you must delete and recreate your character.

1. *Select* your **`Ped`**.\
a. In case you need to reference your ped model, the female ped is known as `mp_f_freemode` and the male ped is known as `mp_m_freemode`.

2. *Select* **`Inherit`** and create your blend of mother and father **inheritances**.

3. Go through **`Face`** and **`Skin`** to see if there are any facial features you'd like to customize.

4. Go through **`Hair`** to select your preferred hairstyle and hair color.\
a. Please be patient as you flip through the hundreds of hairstyles. You may be downloading hairstyles as you go through each hair option, making it appear as if there are no hairstyles for a specific number.

<Callout type="default">
Within the `Hair` page, please *increase* the **opacity** of `Eyebrows`. By default, your character has eyebrows but they are **not** visible.
</Callout>

5. Go through **`Makeup`** to apply makeup, blush, or lipstick.

6. *Select* `Clothing` to create your character's first outfit. Below are some important notes:\
a. Similar to hairstyles, please be patient as you flip through the hundreds of clothing items.\
b. **Undershirts**: For **male** peds, set to **`15`**. For **female** peds, set to **`14`**.\
c. **Jackets**: These are the majority of the tops (e.g., tanks, tshirt, sweaters, dresses, etc.).\
d. **Hands**: You will need to change this based on your `Jackets` above, so the body type will fit the top and your character won't have "holes" in their top.

<Callout type="default">
We recommend doing the following to check if your character has holes in their top:
1. *Press* **`F8`** key to *open* the game console.
2. *Type* **`/e hands up`** into the game console.
3. *Press* **`F8`** key to *close* the game console.
4. *Press* **`A`**, **`D`**, **`Left Mouse Button`**, or **`Right Mouse Button`** to spin your character around, focusing on your character's top.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
Remember to *select* **`Save Appearance`** or you will lose all progress once you are satisfied with your character's appearance. 

In the event you accidentally *press* **`Cancel`** or the **`ESC`** key, you must delete and recreate your character.
</Callout>

#### **Delete Your Character**

In the event you need to delete your character because you messed up during your character creation or you need to delete a character to make room for a new character, please do the following:
