# §2 🔁 Server Restart 🔁
This gives us the opportunity to implement frequent updates and helps us maintain an optimized server.



Renegade Roleplay has scheduled restarts **4 times daily** at 12 am, 6 am, 12 pm, and 6 pm ET.

If you are on Renegade near the scheduled restart time, please ensure you *quit* <font color="#FF8C3E"> **FiveM** </font> application completely and relaunch <font color="#FF8C3E"> **FiveM** </font> after ~ 1 minute.

Restarts typically take less than 1 minute for the server to be online again. If you have trouble reconnecting, please reach out in [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/renegaderoleplay) via [`#support-chat`](https://discord.com/channels/1083964697532973157/1083965261750738984).
