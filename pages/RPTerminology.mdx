**On the train** = in queue to get into the server\
**Take a nap** = relog / reconnect to the game\
**Go to sleep** = logging off

**Voices inside your head** = Twitch chat or discord call (I don't recommend being in a discord call while in game)\
**Inside my head / anything that involves doing something by yourself** = AFK or non-responsive in game\
**Spider on your foot / need to jump** = You're teleporting around or animation is stuck\
